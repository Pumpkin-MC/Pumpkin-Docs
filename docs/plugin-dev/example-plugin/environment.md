# Setting up a development environment
## Installing rust
To build a plugin for pumpkin, you will need to have the rust toolchain installed on your system. We recommend you follow the [official installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for this.
## Building Pumpkin
To be able to test the plugin during development, you will need a build of the Pumpkin server software to run the plugins. You can follow the [quickstart guide](/about/quick-start) if you don't yet have a build.
