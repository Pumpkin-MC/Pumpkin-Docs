# Quick Start

**Current Status:**

Pre-release: Currently under development and not yet ready for official release.

To get Pumpkin running, you first have to clone it:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Pumpkin-MC/Pumpkin.git
cd Pumpkin
```

You may also have to [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you don't already have it.

**Optional:**

You can place a vanilla world into the Pumpkin/ directory if you want. Just name the World `world`

Then run:

> [!NOTE]
> This can take a while because we enabled heavy optimizations for release builds
>
> To apply further optimizations specific to your CPU and use your CPU features, you should set the target-cpu=native
> Rust flag.

```shell
cargo run --release
```

## Docker

Experimental Docker support is available.
The image is currently not published anywhere, but you can use the following command to build and deploy it:

```shell
docker compose up --build
```

After running this command a `data/` folder should appear in which you'll be able to find all the server files.
Within this `data/` folder you can put your `world/` folder (make sure you restart the server)
